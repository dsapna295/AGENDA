# AGENDA

The Agenda application allows the user to keep track of their daily duties by taking notes in this application. Users can simply register themselves and then log in to our application, where they will be able to add and view their notes, as well as see when the specific notes were made. The primary advantage is that they can complete all of these tasks without being redirected to multiple pages.
